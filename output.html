Rather, through an incisive analysis of Boyle’s work diaries, Yeo shows how Boyle preferred recording material chronologically – he organized his books by topic rather than by thematic Heads. Boyle often preferred loose notes, continually jotting tidbits of chemical or medicinal information on sheets of paper. Though subject to being lost or stolen, such notes inspired Boyle to activate his mental facilities.
